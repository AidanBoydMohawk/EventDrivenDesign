**Assignment 2: Event Driven Design**  
**Aidan Boyd**

Not Finished. I’m writing as if it were the complete event I planned

Description: Progress through a house with puzzles to access areas. Use Keys to open doors, flash light to find objects, and buttons to spawn objects to interact with other objects

The events improve overtime as you progress the level. You start with an introductory inventory system with keys. These are used to open doors.   
You have a flashlight that depletes overtime requiring batteries to fill it back up. Your light will decrease radius and have a darken look.   
The final part is a button press system which spawns objects in an inaccessible room. It lands on an object that can go left or right which will open up another area. You have to use the button(s) at the right time to correctly move the object in the right direction 

Challenges faced: To be honest, I am not strong in coding. I was struggling for a good time just to get the key system to work. I watched some videos online, read discussions on forums, but none would help with the code I followed in class. My solution that wasn’t planned was to ask classmates for help. I had a 3 hour phone call with a classmate trying to help me through the code I was working with. They would try ideas to see if it would help. I would take their ideas and experiment with them by trying their code in another place, or rewriting it. It eventually got the key to work with the door, and delete the UI off the screen once used.   
There was no time left for the rest of the level. Based off of how I got they key to work I bet it would have taken me 10-15 hours to complete the next puzzle
